Problem 2:

Write a client-server TCP application using JAVA, where the client sends more than one messages to the server. 
Server receives each message and prints it in the server side, without any modification of that message. 
For this implementation, take a user input inside the client to get the number of messages to be sent to the server.
After that, start sending that number of messages from the client side. On the other hand, 
server just prints all the messages sent to it one-by-one, by the client. [5 marks]
