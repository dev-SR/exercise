## Basic

### Opening a File

- Python has a built-in function `open()` to open a file
- This function returns a file object, also called a file handle, as it is used to read or modify the file accordingly

```python
f = open("read.txt")
```

We can specify the mode while opening a file. In mode, we specify whether we want to read `'r'`, write `'w'` or append `'x'` to the file. We also specify if we want to
open the file in text mode or binary mode.

There are 2 types of Files:

- Text Files
- Binary Files

#### Python File Modes

- `'r'` Open a file for reading. (default)
- `'W'` Open a file for writing. Creates a new file if it does not exist or truncates the file if it exists.
- `'a'` Open for appending at the end of the file without truncating it. Creates a new file if it does not exist.
- `'t'` Open in text mode. (default)
- `'b'` Open in binary mode.
- `'+'` Open a file for updating (reading and writing)

```python
f = open("read.txt",'r')
f = open("write.txt",'w')
```

### Closing a File

Closing a file will free up the resources that were tied with the file and is done using the `close()` method.
Python has a garbage collector to clean up unreferenced objects but, we must not rely on it to close the file.

```python
f = open("read.txt")
f.close()
```

### Context Managers (with)

- In Python, de-allocation of resources can be achieved by the usage of context managers which facilitate the
proper handling of resources.
- The most common way of performing file operations is by using the `with` keyword.

```python

with open('read.txt','r') as f:
 print("Inside: ",f.closed) # `False`

print("Outside: ",f.closed) # `True` that means file is already closed

```

    Inside:  False
    Outside:  True

## Writing to a file

- In order to write some content to a file, we need to open file in 'w' or 'a' mode.
- writing a string or sequence of bytes can be done using `write()`
- Returns the number of characters written

```python
with open('write.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
 f.write("This file has been generated by Python.\n")
 r = f.write("I love python\n")
 r1 = f.write("❤❤❤")  # encoding='utf-8'
 print(r,r1)
```

## Reading from a file

- You can read the content from a file using a method called `read()` ,`readline()`, `readlines()`.

sample text:

- This is line 1 sen-1. This is line 1 sen-2.
- This is line 2.
- This is line 3.
- This is line 4.

```python
with open('read.txt', 'r') as f:

 # reads only 5 chars
 data = f.read(5)
 print(data)

 # reads next 10 charaters
 data = f.read(10)
 print(data)

```

    This
    is line 1

| `single_string = file.read()`     | Reads **all the elements of the file** into a **single** `string`(`\n` characters might be included). EX: `"line 1\n line 2\n line3\n"` |
| `line = file.readline()`          | **Reads the current line** where the cursor as a string is positioned and **moves to the next line**.  EX: `"line 1"`                   |
| `list_strings = file.readlines()` | **Makes a `list` of strings**. EX: `['line 1\n', 'line 2\n', 'line3\n'`]                                                                |

```python
with open('read.txt', 'r') as f:
 # reads complete data and stores as String
 data= f.read()
 print(type(data))
 print(len(data))
 print(data.strip())

```

    <class 'str'>
    107
    This is line 1 sen-1. This is line 1 sen-2.
    This is line 2.
    This is line 3.
    This is line 4.
    This is line 5.

```python
with open('read.txt', 'r') as f:

 # reads 1 line at a time
 data= f.readline()
 print(type(data))
 print(len(data))
 print(data)

 # reads 2nd lien
 data= f.readline()
 print(data)
```

    <class 'str'>
    44
    This is line 1 sen-1. This is line 1 sen-2.

    This is line 2.

```python
with open('read.txt', 'r') as f:

 # reads complete data and stores in list
 data= f.readlines()
 print(type(data))
 print(data)
 print("Total lines: ",len(data))
```

    <class 'list'>
    ['This is line 1 sen-1. This is line 1 sen-2.\n', 'This is line 2.\n', 'This is line 3.\n', 'This is line 4.\n', 'This is line 5.']
    Total lines:  5

```python
print("Total lines: ",len(open("read.txt").readlines()))
```

    Total lines:  5

### Read line by line

##### using for loop

```python
with open('read.txt', 'r') as f:
 for line in f:
  print(line.strip())
```

    This is line 1 sen-1. This is line 1 sen-2.
    This is line 2.
    This is line 3.
    This is line 4.
    This is line 5.

```python
with open('read.txt', 'r') as f:
 for i, l in enumerate(f):
  print(i, l, end="")
```

    0 This is line 1 sen-1. This is line 1 sen-2.
    1 This is line 2.
    2 This is line 3.
    3 This is line 4.
    4 This is line 5.

#### using `readline()`, `readlines()`

```python
with open('read.txt', 'r') as f:
 line = f.readline()
 print(type(line))

 while line:
  print(line.strip())
  line = f.readline()
```

    <class 'str'>
    This is line 1 sen-1. This is line 1 sen-2.
    This is line 2.
    This is line 3.
    This is line 4.
    This is line 5.

```python
with open('read.txt', 'r') as f:
 data = f.readlines()
 print(type(data))

 for line in data:
  # print(line,end="")
  print(line.strip())

```

    <class 'list'>
    This is line 1 sen-1. This is line 1 sen-2.
    This is line 2.
    This is line 3.
    This is line 4.
    This is line 5.

### The file handle

**File handle** is like a `cursor`, which defines from where the data has to be read or written in the file.

1. `tell()`: **current the position**
2. `f.seek(offset, from_what)`:
   - **change the position** of the File Handle to a given specific position.
   - `Offset`: Number of positions to move forward
   - `from_what`: It defines point of reference `0,1,2`.
       - `0`: sets the reference point at the `beginning` of the file
       - `1`: sets the reference point at the `current` file position
       - `2`: sets the reference point at the `end` of the file

```python
with open('read.txt', 'r') as f:
 # file handle at beginning
 print("current pos:",f.tell())
 print(f.readline().strip())
 print("current pos:",f.tell())

 # take file handle to the beginning
 f.seek(0)
 print("current pos:",f.tell())
 print(f.readline().strip())
 print("current pos:",f.tell())


```

    current pos: 0
    This is line 1 sen-1. This is line 1 sen-2.
    current pos: 45
    current pos: 0
    This is line 1 sen-1. This is line 1 sen-2.
    current pos: 45

```python
with open('read.txt', 'r') as f:
 print(len(f.read()))
 f.seek(0)
 print("current pos:",f.tell())
 print(f.readline().strip())
 print("current pos:",f.tell())

 f.seek(10)
 print("current pos:",f.tell())
 print(f.readline().strip())
 print("current pos:",f.tell())

 f.seek(0,1)
 print("current pos:",f.tell())
 print(f.readline().strip())
 print("current pos:",f.tell())

 f.seek(0,2)
 print("current pos:",f.tell())
 print(f.readline().strip())
```

    107
    current pos: 0
    This is line 1 sen-1. This is line 1 sen-2.
    current pos: 45
    current pos: 10
    ne 1 sen-1. This is line 1 sen-2.
    current pos: 45
    current pos: 45
    This is line 2.
    current pos: 62
    current pos: 111

### Read Block by Block

```python
number_of_blocks = 4
with open('read_block.txt', 'r') as f:
 for block in range(number_of_blocks):
  f.seek(0,2)
  file_size = f.tell() # total no of characters
  print(file_size)
```

    14
    14
    14
    14

```python
number_of_blocks = 10

with open('read_block.txt', 'r') as f:
 for block in range(number_of_blocks):
  # print(block,100  * '=')
  f.seek(block*(file_size//number_of_blocks),0)
  data = f.read(file_size//number_of_blocks)
  # print(data)
  # print(len(data.strip()))


```

## Appending to a file

- file mode 'a' can be used to append to the existing file

```python
with open('read.txt', 'r') as f:
 print(f.read())

print()

with open('read.txt', 'a') as f:
 f.write("\nAppending this line at the end")

with open('read.txt', 'r') as f:
 print(f.read())
```

    Hello World
    From file

    Hello World
    From file
    Appending this line at the end

## Changing the content in a file

```python
filename = 'read.txt'
data = None

with open(filename,'r') as f:
 data= f.readlines()

print(data)
```

    ['Hello World\n', 'From file\n', 'Appending this line at the end']

```python
data[-1] = "Python is FUN !!❤❤"
print(data)

```

    ['Hello World\n', 'From file\n', 'Python is FUN !!❤❤']

```python
data_to_write = "".join(data)
data_to_write
```

    'Hello World\nFrom file\nPython is FUN !!❤❤'

```python
with open('temp.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
 f.write(data_to_write)
```
