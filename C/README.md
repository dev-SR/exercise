### Why is the C language called a 'Structured Programming Language'?

C is called a structured programming language because to solve a large problem, C programming language divides the problem into smaller modules called functions or procedures each of which handles a particular responsibility. The program which solves the entire problem is a collection of such functions.

One major drawback of C language is that **similar functions cannot be grouped inside a module or class**. Also, **functions cannot be associated to a type or structure**. ***Thus data and functions cannot be bound together***. C++ language overcomes these problems by introducing object oriented functionality in its programming capabilities.
