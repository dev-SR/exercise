# Dynamic Memory Allocation in C++

## Introduction

C++ allows us to allocate the memory of a variable or an array in run time. This is known as **dynamic memory allocation**.

In other programming languages such as Java and Python, the compiler automatically manages the memories allocated to variables. But this is not the case in C++.

In C++, we need to de-allocate the dynamically allocated memory manually after we have no use for the variable.

We can allocate and then de-allocate memory dynamically using the `new` and `delete` operators respectively.
